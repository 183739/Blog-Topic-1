# Blog-Topic

My blog is going to be about new trends in art. It will feature new methods, styles, and concepts that people are playing with in the art world. I want it to serve as an informative blog that inspires artists to try new things. I will feature personal artwork as well as artwork from professional artists. On a few posts I want to take new ideas or techniques that I've learned and apply them to my own artwork so that others can see how well that particular method works.
